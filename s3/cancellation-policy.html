                                DRPINFOTECH PRIVATE LIMITED believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a
                                liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="legal-list">

                                    Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 7 days of placing the order.
                                    However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
                                    vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    DRPINFOTECH PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers,
                                    eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of
                                    product delivered is not good.
                                </li>

                                    In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer Service team.
                                    The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his
                                    own end. This should be reported within 7 days of receipt of the products.
